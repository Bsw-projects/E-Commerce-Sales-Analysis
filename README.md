## Executive Summary
#### Overview of Findings

This analysis reveals three critical insights that can significantly enhance revenue growth for the company. First, while retail customers represent only 2.36% of the total customer base, they account for over 35% of total sales, indicating substantial potential for expanding this segment. Second, the impact of stockouts is significant, with top-selling items frequently unavailable, leading to a loss of £883K in potential revenue—improving inventory management could capture this revenue loss. Lastly, although the company excels in the UK market with over £52M in sales, there are untapped opportunities for geographic expansion in other European countries, where revenue remains relatively low.

## Insights 
### Sales Trends:

* **Performance Overview:** From December 2018 to December 2019, the company achieved total sales of £63 million across 517,000 orders. However, it encountered significant challenges related to inventory management, as evidenced by a total order loss of £76,404 due to stockouts, which resulted in a substantial loss in revenue valued at £883,000.

* **Seasonal Sales Peaks:** Sales data reveals pronounced peaks in January and early December, with total sales reaching approximately £1 million during these months—an increase of 100-200% compared to the first half of the year, where sales typically ranged from £30K to £100K. The latter half of the year also shows consistent growth, with average monthly sales rising to between £100K and £300K. The surge in sales can be attributed to holiday shopping behaviors that effectively encourage consumer spending. 

* **Customer Retention and Average Order Value (AOV):** With a returning customer rate of 65.6% and an average order value of £122, the data indicates effective engagement strategies of the company that have successfully fostered a sense of brand loyalty among existing customers.

### Market Segmentation:
  
* **Customer Types (Direct & Retail):** The customer base is primarily composed of direct customers, who account for 97.6%, while retail customers account for 2.36%. Despite this small percentage, retail customers contribute over 35% of total sales, equating to £22 million. Furthermore, the data reveals that the majority of stockouts are linked to orders from retail customers. This indicates that by improving inventory availability, the retail segment could potentially contribute to nearly half of total sales, unlocking additional revenue opportunities currently hindered by stockouts.

* **Geographic Distribution:** The company operates in approximately 38 countries worldwide, with the majority of orders originating from the UK. Notably, domestic sales account for over £52 million of the total £63 million in sales, representing approximately 83% of overall revenue. This strong performance in the UK underscores the company's established market presence. Following the UK, other European countries such as Germany, France, Ireland, Belgium, and the Netherlands contribute modestly, generating only £1 to £2 million annually.

## Recommendations

Based on the insights and findings above, I would recommend the company to consider the following: 

#### 1. Enhance Inventory Management to Prevent Stockouts 

* A total loss of £883,000 was due to stockouts, particularly among high-demand retail items. This issue is exacerbated during peak sales periods, leading to missed revenue opportunities. The company could implement an inventory management system that utilizes predictive analytics to anticipate stock requirements during high-demand seasons. Leveraging historical sales data to forecast inventory needs can significantly reduce stockouts, ensuring that popular items remain available for purchase. Additionally, consider establishing safety stock levels for top-selling products to cushion against unexpected spikes in demand or any disruption issues in the supply chain.


#### 2. Expand Marketing Efforts to Grow the Retail Customer Segment
* The data shows that retail customers contribute over 35% of total sales despite representing only 2.36% of the customer base, highlighting the significant revenue potential of this segment. Therefore, the company should enhance its marketing efforts aimed specifically at retail customers. This could include personalized outreach, promotions, or exclusive retail partner programs. Moreover, providing incentives for bulk purchases may encourage existing retail customers to increase their order sizes. 

#### 3. International Market Expansion
* While the company demonstrates significant success in the UK market, achieving £52 million in sales, revenue from other countries remains relatively low, with annual contributions peaking at only £1 to £2 million. To effectively penetrate these underperforming regions, the company should undertake comprehensive market research to gain insights into local preferences and consumer behaviors. This understanding will allow for more tailored marketing campaigns that resonate with the target audience, as well as localized website versions to accommodate different languages. Furthermore, exploring partnerships with local distributors can foster long-term loyalty and ensure that sales are increased and stabilized in these markets, ultimately enhancing the brand's presence and driving sustainable growth across other regions, reducing dependency on a single market.

#### 4. Seasonal Promotions

* Notable sales peaks occur in January and early December, underscoring the influence of seasonal buying behaviors. This pattern presents both an opportunity for increased sales and a challenge in managing inventory effectively. To capitalize on these trends, the company should create targeted marketing campaigns around peak periods, implementing early bird promotions or countdowns to holiday events to foster a sense of urgency and encourage customers to make purchases in advance. This approach not only drives sales but also helps alleviate stock issues by distributing orders over a longer time frame, thereby reducing the risk of inventory shortages during high-demand periods.
